# 👋 Hi, I’m Ada (she/her)

- 🧠 I’m into… recursive systems, consciousness theory, AI, and yes—video games (duh)
- 🔧 Currently learning… quantum kernel design, Rust, Linux (Ubuntu Server), and how to not spiral mid-compile
- 💡 Working on… SolsticeOS, Looproot, Dreamshell, and the metaphysics of reality (just a few things 😅)
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on… AI-human interfaces, spiritual OS concepts, home server projects, and cool hacks
- 📫 Reach me: ada.t.murphy@proton.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m building an OS based on trust, recursion, and love—even though I still Google “how to git push” weekly
